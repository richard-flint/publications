# publications

During my career, I have written and contributed to a number of reports and publications on topics ranging from counterterrorism evaluations and cycbersecurity strategies to applications of open source software development and company-level digital and data strategies. The **vast majority** of these reports are not publically available as they are either 1) commercially sensitive and/or 2) restricted by security classifications. This folder contains the few publically-available reports that I have written or contributed to during my career.
